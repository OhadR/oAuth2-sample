butkec is an oauth client.
butkers is the oauth resource server.
the authorization server is butke-up


deploy butkec-demo and butkers-demo to tomcat.

browse http://localhost:8080/butkec-demo/hello

butkec needs login by itsealf : shalom/shalom

then it will try to call butkers url http://localhost:8080/butkers-demo/welcome

this will redirect to oauth authentication to butke-up (should be running on tomcat and configured just as for watchdox)

login to butke-up, depends whats in the db, usually shalom@m.watchdox.com/molahs

then butkec should access butkers and print a message.
